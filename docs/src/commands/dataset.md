# Dataset

The `dataset` subcommand is used to import data from the [Stray Scanner](https://www.strayrobots.io/products/scanner) app to be used with the rest of the Stray toolkit.

## Available commands
## `stray dataset import`
Imports data from the [Stray Scanner](https://www.strayrobots.io/products/scanner) app into the [scene format](/formats/data.md)

#### Options

|name|default|choices|description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`<scenes>`| | |Paths to the raw scenes. The `rgb.mp4` file needs to be present at minimum for scenes to be used in [camera calibration](/commands/calibration.html), the `depth` directory also needs to exist for scenes to be [integrated](/commands/studio.md#stray-studio-integrate-scenes-directory))|
|`--out, -o`| | |Directory where to save the imported scenes|
|`--every`| 1 | |Skip frames|
|`--width`| 1920 | |Width of the imported images. Make sure to match the `camera_intrinsics.json` width in case `--intrinsics` is passed|
|`--height`| 1440 | |Height of the imported images. Make sure to match the `camera_intrinsics.json` height in case `--intrinsics` is passed|
|`--intrinsics`| None | |Path to a custom `camera_intrinsics.json` (for example, generated by the [calibration](/commands/calibration.html) command) to include in the imported scene instead of parameters found in the `camera_matrix.csv` (if present)|
|`--help, -h`| | |Show help|


## `stray dataset show`

- Displays the dataset optionally with labels of different types

#### Options

|name|default|choices|description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`<scenes>`| | |Paths to the Stray scene(s) to show|
|`--bbox`| False |(flag)|Render 2D bounding boxes based on the annotations.json file|
|`--segmentation`| False |(flag)|Render segmentation masks on the images (masks can be created with `stray dataset bake`|
|`--bbox-from-mask`| False |(flag)|Determine the 2D bounding box from segmentation mask (masks can be created with `stray dataset bake`|
|`--save`| False |(flag)|Save the shown images to scene/labeled_examples |
|`--rate, -r`| 30 | |Frame rate|
|`--help, -h`| | |Show help|


## `stray dataset bake`

- Bake different assets (such as segmentation masks) into the dataset

#### Options

|name|default|choices|description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`<scenes>`| | |Paths to the Scenes into which assets should be baked|
|`--segmentation`| False |(flag)|Bake segmentation masks to the scene. The masks are saved as pickles into scene/segmentation/instance_i folders based on the number of bounding boxes in the scene|
|`--help, -h`| | |Show help|
