#### Options

|name|default|choices|description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`<scenes>`| | |Paths to the raw scenes. The `rgb.mp4` file needs to be present at minimum for scenes to be used in [camera calibration](/commands/calibration.html), the `depth` directory also needs to exist for scenes to be [integrated](/commands/studio.md#stray-studio-integrate-scenes-directory))|
|`--width`| 640 | |Width of the imported images. Make sure to match the `camera_intrinsics.json` width in case `--intrinsics` is passed|
|`--height`| 480 | |Height of the imported images. Make sure to match the `camera_intrinsics.json` height in case `--intrinsics` is passed|
|`--intrinsics`| None | |Path to a custom `camera_intrinsics.json` (for example, generated by the [calibration](/commands/calibration.html) command) to include in the imported scene instead of parameters found in the `camera_matrix.csv` (if present)|
|`--help, -h`| | |Show help|
