# Integrate

Command: `stray integrate <scenes-directory>`

Reads color and depth images from a scene to compute the trajectory of the camera and produces a mesh of the scene. After this has been done, the scene can be opened in the Studio with the open command.

The scene directory has to follow the [dataset format](/formats/data.md#dataset-format).
