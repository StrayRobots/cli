# Annotating scenes

The video below, shows how to open scenes in Stray Studio and add bounding box annotations. Bounding boxes can be useful if you are dealing with box like objects, or you simply want to detect the presence, distance and rough size of an object.

<div style="text-align: center;">

Once we added bounding box labels, these can be used to generate 3D bounding box, 2D bounding box, corner keypoints or semantic segmentation labels for learning.

While this video showed you how to add bounding boxes, you can also annotate your scene with keypoints and rectangles. You can switch to the rectangle annotation tool by pressing `R` and to the keypoint tool by pressing `K`. If there are any other annotation types you would like to see, let us know.
